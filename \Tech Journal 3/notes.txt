open dchp01
nmtui -enter this and config the following
IP Address and Netmask 10.0.5.3/24
Gateway10.0.5.2
DNS 10.0.5.5
Search Domain yourname.local
Hostname dhcp01-yourname

add a new privlaged user by :
	adduser admin
	usermod -aG root admin
https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-create-a-sudo-user-on-ubuntu/

use the following command for the first deliverable:
	"ping google.com -c 1 && ping 10.0.5.2 -c 1 && ping 10.0.5.5 -c 1"

add an A and PTR record for dhcp01 to the DNS configuration on ad01.  Test this by issuing a ping from wks01 to dhcp01 using the undistinguished hostname.

use the following(this is copy pasted from journal week 2) and modify with the correct values
	Adding a DNS Record
    --Find and invoke DNS Manager from the Server Manager/DNS/AD01 context menu
    --Find and expand the forward lookup zone for your new domain
    --You should have an entry for ad01.yourname.  This allows you to ping ad01 by hostname and/or domain name.  We are going to add an 		entry for fw01 
    --From the DNS Manager, select New Host (A or AAAA name):
    --Add a reference to fw01-john, go ahead and check "Create associated (PTR) record"\


everything else like creating directories(mkdir directoryname) and moving around and copying is super easy....also we have man pages so
im not going to put that all in here
