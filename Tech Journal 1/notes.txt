then logged in using the cyber domain credentials

The OpnSense firewall will provides routing services between a Local Area Network and Wide Area Network in your VSphere environment.

modify the settings of your fw01 VM and make sure that the first network adapter is assigned to WAN and the second 
assigned to the LAN-yourname network as shown in the following figure.
(THis is done by clicking "action" and "edit settings" and then going to the networking section.  Network adapter 1 is already assigned to WAN so we just need to fix the 2nd adapter
clicked "browse" and selected my cyber name from the list)


Power on your fw01 VM and Open a VM Console
	--hit the summary tab of the vsphere client and under the image of the vm their is a tab called "launch web console"
	--the default login is root as the username and Ch@mpl@1n!19 is the password
	
Select 1 to  reassign Interfaces and follow the following steps
	-hit no to configure VLAn's now
	-The WAN interface name should be changed to em0
	-The LAN interface name should be changed to em1
	-When prompted for an optional interface, just select <ENTER>
	-If successful, your interfaces should look like this:
		WAN -> em0
		LAN -> em1

Step 2 Set interface IP address
	-enter 2 to set the interface IP address
	-Do not use DHCP to configure the WAN IPv4 address, use 10.0.17.141
	-enter 24 cuz your on a /24 mask
	-For the WAN, my upstream gateway is 10.0.17.2
	-Use the gateway as IPv4 name server
	-not using ipv6 so skip that section
	-When asked about HTTP for the GUI, say no cuz security 

Select 2 again to configure the other Interface's IP Address
	-this time enter 1 to edit the LAN inteface
	-Not using DHCP
	-IP address is 10.0.5.2
	-use a 24 bit mask
	-do not have an upstream LAN gateway as you are the gateway
	-No DHCP
	-bypass IPV6 config by hitting enter
	-dont enable a LAN DHCP server and dont revert to HTTP


Windows 10 - wks01
Figure out how to adjust wks01's VMWare Network Configuration such that it is on your LAN segment (see below)
	- go edit the network settings, browse and select your name @ local
	-open up a console just like you did above
	-edit network setting to be the following

	IP = 10.0.5.100
	mask = 255.255.255.0
	gateway = 10.0.5.2
change hostname to wks01-john
go to sytem change name and enter the desired hostname

go to https://10.0.5.2  inside the vm

The following are screens where you need to change the default.
System Wizard: General Information
Hostname: fw1-yourname
Domain: yourname.local
System Wizard:  Configure WAN Interface
RFC1918 Networks:  Uncheck "Block private networks from entering via WAN"
System Wizard:  Set Root Password, its Up to you.  If you set it you need to remember it.

I will be looking into automating some steps via powershell later this week

so the firewall lets us backup to a xml config file, which can be saved via using cat in powershell and copy and pasting it into a file, or just emailing the file to yourself.  The config backup will be tested in my freetime, multiple times to ensure stability and so as to learn how to rapidly deploy.
