Using your friends at google, figure out how to disable SSH root user access to dhcp01
(Hint: this should involve a small edit to a single file). 
Prove you have done this correctly by conducting a test via PuTTY.
  -nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
  -edit #PermitRootLogin yes to PermitRootLogin no
  -on ad01 use ssh root@10.0.5.3 to test this
  -cat /var/log/secure | grep "not met" (this checks for denied logins to root)
